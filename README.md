# my-first-html
On this application I made a standard HTML page with Bootstrap mobile responsivness and CSS styling. On this week application is a page all about me and my coding journey. There is bootstrap carousel demostrating some exemplary work I have done during my course at PENN LPS Coding Boot Camp. Also, lower on down the web page is a list of my contact info.
